            Pushups are beneficial for building upper body strength. They<strong> work the triceps, pectoral muscles, and shoulders</strong>. When done with proper form, they can also strengthen the lower back and core by engaging (pulling in) the abdominal muscles.

        <p class="paragraph">Some people think the number of push-ups a person can do is an indicator of their upper body strength. In reality, push-ups are a measure of muscle endurance. A one-minute push-up test is one of the fitness tests used to measure muscle endurance. </p>
